We are liable to become victims of our own unconsciously held philosophy or of the philosophy of others, which may rule us all the more tyrannically because it is hidden and operates in the dark.

At its foundation is what I shall call common sense realism.

This is one of the reasons that the writings of Rav Saadia Gaon, the Chovos Halevavos, Kuzari, Moreh Nevuchim and Sefer HaIkrim are rarely studied in our times (at least not comprehensively). </p>"},{"location":"daas/common-sense/#the-rejection-of-plan-and-purpose","title":"The Rejection of Plan and Purpose","text":"<p>A quick summary of the \u201cEnlightenment\u201d as portrayed in our times:  Religion is based on blind faith. So the founders of modern Western sought to free science and philosophy from its irrational embrace so as to eliminate its influence from public life, and to indoctrinate students into the new religion of materialistic Scientism. </p> <p>The consequence of this is our post-truth post-modern age of irrationality. The moderns had things backward. It would be truer to say that they falsely accused classical thought of resting on blind faith so that they could justify their rejection of it, and they were smart enough to be able to cook up a new conception of what should count as \u201crational\u201d in the hope of making the accusation stick. They thereby destroyed the intellectual foundations, not only of religion, but of any possible objective morality, and of science itself. </p> <p>In an article in The Atlantic Monthly in 1948, the philosopher W.T. Stace (an empiricist who was not himself in sympathy with classical philosophy) said this about the moderns\u2019 decision to abandon that philosophy:</p> <p>The real turning point between the medieval age of faith and the modern age of unfaith came when the scientists of the seventeenth century turned their backs upon what used to be called \u201cfinal causes\u201d. . . [belief in which] was not the invention of Christianity [but] was basic to the whole of Western civilization, whether in the ancient pagan world or in Christendom, from the time of Socrates to the rise of science in the seventeenth century. \u2026 They did this on the ground that inquiry into purposes is useless for what science aims at: namely, the prediction and control of events. \u2026 The conception of purpose in the world was ignored and frowned upon. This, though silent and almost unnoticed, was the greatest revolution in human history, far outweighing in importance any of the political revolutions whose thunder has reverberated through the world. \u2026 The world, according to this new picture, is purposeless, senseless, meaningless. Nature is nothing but matter in motion. The motions of matter are governed, not by any purpose, but by blind forces and laws. \u2026 [But] if the scheme of things is purposeless and meaningless, then the life of man is purposeless and meaningless too. Everything is futile, all effort is in the end worthless. A man may, of course, still pursue disconnected ends, money, fame, art, science, and may gain pleasure from them. But his life is hollow at the center. Hence, the dissatisfied, disillusioned, restless, spirit of modern man. \u2026 Along with the ruin of the religious vision there went the ruin of moral principles and indeed of all values. \u2026 If our moral rules do not proceed from something outside us in the nature of the universe \u2013 whether we say it is G-d or simply the universe itself \u2013 then they must be our own inventions. Thus it came to be believed that moral rules must be merely an expression of our own likes and dislikes. But likes and dislikes are notoriously variable. What pleases one man, people or culture, displeases another. Therefore, morals are wholly relative.</p>"},{"location":"daas/common-sense/#plan-and-purpose","title":"Plan and Purpose","text":"<p>But do we not see that the purpose of the eyes are to see and the purpose of the heart is to pump blood. On what basis did these men of \u201cenlightenment\u201d reject a cosmos buzzing with plan and purpose? On no basis whatsoever! </p> <p>The philosopher and historian of science E.A. Burtt, in his classic study of The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science (p305 to 306), writes that \u201cwishful thinking\u201d lay behind the belief of the philosophers of the \u201cEnlightenment\u201d (basing themselves on Hume, Kant etc.) that all the phenomena previously explained in Aristotelian terms could be readily accommodated by a new science in which formal and final causes were replaced by entirely quantifiable properties of the kind suitable for prediction and control of nature, and subsequent technological application.</p> <p>\u201cThe sources of distraction [from this ambition] simply had to be denied or removed, \u2026  and any solution of the ultimate questions which continued to pop up, however superficial and inconsistent, that served to quiet the situation, to give a tolerably plausible response to their questionings in the categories they were now familiar with, and above all to open before them a free field for their fuller mathematical exploitation of nature, tended to be readily accepted and tucked away in their minds with uncritical confidence.\u201d</p> <p>Burtt wrote this even though he was sympathetic to the modern project. His statements parallels the acknowledgment by more contemporary writers like Nagel and Lewontin that the naturalistic interpretation of science to which they are committed is less an independently motivated philosophical position than an attempt to prevent a \u201cdivine foot\u201d from getting in the door. The rejection of the proofs for the existence and Unity of G-d is based on wishful thinking and errors made by some very smart early moderns.</p> <p>The corruptions of daas in the modern era is profound.

It\u2019s much worse today, for we are now in a post-modern post-truth generation that even Bloom might not have imagined. </p> <p>Robert Reilly  (provacatively) argued that there was a much more dramatic \u201cclosing of the mind\u201d that happened in the Muslim world 800 years ago that is at the heart of the modern conflict between Islam and the West. (The Closing of the Muslim Mind: How Intellectual Suicide Created the Modern Islamist Crisis). The gist of Reilly\u2019s argument is aptly summarized in the forward to the book by philosopher Roger Scruton: </p> <p>[Reilly\u2019s] purpose is to show that Islamic civilization, which led to the urbane princedoms of Andalusia in the West, and to the mystical laughter of the Sufis in the East, underwent a moral and intellectual crisis in the ninth to the eleventh century of our era, when it turned its back on philosophy and took refuge in dogma. Several factors are responsible for this ossification, but the principle one, in Reilly\u2019s view, was the rise of the Asharite sect in the tenth century and the defeat of the rival sect of the Mutazalites. The Asharites found a potent voice in the Imam al-Ghazali (d. 1111), a brilliant philosopher and theologian whose tormented spirit found refuge at the last in a mystical oneness with Allah. Human reason teaches us to question things, to discover things, and to make new laws for our better governance. Hence reason was\u2014for al-Ghazali\u2014the enemy of Islam, which requires absolute and unquestioning submission to the will of Allah. In his celebrated treatise The Incoherence of the Philosophers, al-Ghazali set out to show that reason, as enshrined in the writings of Plato, Aristotle, and their followers, leads to nothing save darkness and contradiction, and that the only light that shines in the mind of man is the light of revelation. Although al-Ghazali\u2019s arguments are soundly refuted by Averroes (Ibn Rushd) in his The Incoherence of the Incoherence, Islam rushed to embrace the Asharite doctrine, which made so much better sense of the ruling idea of submission. Averroes was sent from Andalusia into exile, and the voice of reason was no more heard in the courts of Sunni Muslim princes.</p> <p>Rambam in the Moreh Nevuchim was highly critical of the Asharite sect (Kalam). Many of his criticisms apply to the modern intellectual enterprise which are the rotten fruits of the \u201cEnlightenment\u201d (more on this later).  </p>"},{"location":"daas/commonsense-loss/#ground-zero","title":"Ground Zero","text":"<p>One cannot reason with a dogmatist or a skeptic. One cannot reason with a skeptic who holds an attitude of radical doubt, believing that any knowledge or truth is unattainable (which is inherently self-defeating for what then is the basis of skepticism?). Evidence and reason are pointless since they doubt the possibility of arriving at any truth. One cannot reason with a dogmatist who believes they already possess the truth and therefore are not open to evidence or reason of any kind. This rigidity makes genuine reasoning impossible because they aren\u2019t seeking understanding or truth through discourse; they\u2019re committed to defending their existing position at all costs.</p> <p>The loss of the ancient world\u2019s single greatest archive of knowledge, the Library of Alexandria, has been lamented for ages.

Upon learning of \u201ca great library containing all the knowledge of the world\u201d the conquering general supposedly asked Caliph Omar for instructions. The Caliph has been quoted as saying of the Library\u2019s holdings, \u201cThey will either contradict the Koran, in which case they are heresy, or they will agree with it, so they are superfluous.\u201d  It was rumored that all the texts were destroyed by using them as tinder for the bathhouses of the city, and then it was said to have taken six months to burn all the documents.<sup>2</sup></p> <p>Like all sweeping narratives of history, Reilly\u2019s Closing of the Muslim Mind no doubt omits certain important exceptions and qualifications. But if the general outline of Reilly\u2019s thesis is correct, it means that there is a lot of preparatory work to do before fruitful dialogue between Islam and the West can take place. It also means that simplistic attempts to \u201cbring democracy\u201d to the Muslim world are ultimately doomed to failure, for that world has been separated from the intellectual culture in which democracy can take root and subsist.</p> <p>What we need to discover is the ground zero of reason. What is that neutral ground that is neither skeptical nor dogmatic but is properly basic as the foundation on which reason can rest?

No reasonable person supports open borders to allow in, unchecked, gangs, drugs, and terrorists (or the 9/11 Islamic terrorists who brought down the World Trade Center). No reasonable person supports surgically sterilizing young children in the name of transgenderism. No reasonable person celebrates the atrocities of Hamas terrorists. Such policies spell disaster for any civilization.</p> <p>The American Medical Association advocates that birth certificates should not report the biological sex of a newborn because its \u201csex\u201d is uncertain as it might change in the future.  This is how leftism has corrupted medicine and science. Biologically, sex is binary, either male (sperm gametes) or female (ova gametes); there is no third type of gamete. </p> <p>At the confirmation hearing of the the Biden-Harris nominee, Ketanji Brown Jackson, for the Supreme Court, Sen. Marsha Blackburn asked the nominee: \u201cCan you provide a definition for the word \u2018woman\u2019?\u201d Jackson, appearing confused, responded, \u201cI\u2019m not a biologist.\u201d  Blackburn chided Jackson, claiming that \u201cthe fact that you can\u2019t give me a straight answer about something as fundamental as what a woman is underscores the dangers of the kind of progressive education that we are hearing about.\u201d Ketanji Brown was appointed for being the first black woman to the Supreme Court! How did we get to the point that scientists and medical men can say that \u201cmen can become pregnant\u201d? </p> <p>Why does the Smithsonian Museum have a display that states that reason and the \u201cwork ethic\u201d is white supremacy? Why is the Left waging a war on free-will (criminals are guiltless), on the sanctity of marriage (LGBTQ+), on the classical belief that there are objective moral values? Such absurdities can only happen in the woke dominated West. So how did all this come to be?</p> <p>In Stalin\u2019s Russia, in Mao\u2019s Marxist China and in Castro\u2019s Cuba, the Left used censorship, coercion, force and murder (at a cost of tens of millions of lives) in pursuit of its goal of disrupting civilization. </p> <p>The Left also came to understand that there is a more effective way: the indoctrination of the youth\u2014by stealth\u2014with the promise of a compassionate and just society (that is especially attractive to the Jewish soul). </p> <p>The modern university is the engine of leftism that began percolating throughout the modern university a generation ago. One can see this leftist trajectory of the academy in the career of Richard Rorty (1931\u20132007), an influential American philosopher educated at the University of Chicago and Yale University. Rorty\u2019s academic career included appointments at Princeton and Stanford University.</p> <p>Rorty: This is the concept \u2026 which was used by American school teachers who had read Dewey and were concerned to get students to think \u2018scientifically\u2019 and \u2018rationally\u2019 about such matters as the origin of the species and sexual behaviour (that is, to get them to read Darwin and Freud without disgust and incredulity). It is a concept which I, like most Americans who teach humanities or social science in colleges and universities, invoke when we try to arrange things so that students who enter as bigoted, homophobic, religious fundamentalists will leave college with views more like our own [i.e. like postmodern Marxists of the Left].</p> <p>The racist or fundamentalist parents of our students \u2026 will protest that these books are being jammed down their children\u2019s throats. I cannot see how to reply to this charge without saying something like \u201cThere are credentials for admission to our democratic society, credentials which we liberals have been making more stringent by doing our best to excommunicate racists, male chauvinists, homophobes, and the like. You have to be educated in order to be a citizen of our society, a participant in our conversation, someone with whom we can envisage merging our horizons. So we are going to go right on trying to discredit you in the eyes of your children, trying to strip your fundamentalist religious community of dignity, trying to make your views seem silly rather than discussable. We are not so inclusivist as to tolerate intolerance such as yours.\u201d [Rorty and His Critics, Blackwell, 2000, Universality and Truth, Pages 20\u20131]</p> <p>A defining feature of the Left is that the professoriate will not use reason to enter into a dialogue with students coming from religious homes. Rather, professors will demonize and make fun of the beliefs of these \u201cna\u00efve\u201d students under their care, so that their views will seem so silly as to not even be worthy of discussion.</p> <p>The rejection of (a) the G-d of the Hebrew Bible (and the truths of His Torah), and (b) reason itself\u2013has left mankind adrift in confusion and moral decay that threatens to destroy him from within.</p> <p>The loss of \u05d3\u05e2\u05ea is profound.
